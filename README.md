# TITAN GAME

## Rules
### Game Setup : 

All the cards are shuffled and each player draw 5 cards from the deck.

### How it works ?

Each card represents an individual of a race. 
Each race have a specific power.
When it's its turn, each player draws a card and plays a card from his/her hand in front of him/her. Then he/she applies the power of the card.
The cards in front of a player compose his/her kingdom.
Then it's the turn of the next player.


The game continues even if the deck is empty until one of the players plays his/her last card. Then the other player plays his/her last turn. So each players have played the same number of cards during the game.
Each player receive 1 point for each individual within its kingdom. He/She also receive 3 extra point if he/she has almost one individual of each of the 6 races. The game ends when one of the two players doesn't have cards within his/her hand.
